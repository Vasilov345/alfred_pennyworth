    Make class for custom int, which will behave "vice versa" for comparison operations:
    e.g., int < int means less then, but custom int < int should equal custom int > int.
    Take into account <, >, >=, <=

    Make class which is limited to 2 actions - eat and sleep
    Any other attributes addition should result in an error.

    Make class which never tells about its attributes.
    Its attribute list is always empty and attributes dictionary is always empty.

class CallableInstances:
    """
    Make class which takes func parameter on initialization, which is a callable that can be passed.
    Then object of this class may be called - callable passed on init will be called with passed parameters.
