# "decoration" is just a way to run extra processing steps before and after function execution with "explicit" syntax.
# Put simply, decorators wrap a function, modifying its behavior.

# It comes in two flavors:
# 1. Function decorators specify special operation modes for both simple functions and classesâ€™ methods
#    by wrapping them in an extra layer of logic implemented as another function, usually called a metafunction
# 2. Class decorators do the same for classes, adding support for management of whole objects and their interfaces

    def wrapper():
